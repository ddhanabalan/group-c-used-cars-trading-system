## How to Authenticate

1. Get a login access code from the endpoint `/client_code`
    - Basic Authentication is required with username as client_id and password as client_secret.
    - Response will be in the schema:
        ```
        { client_code: long }
        ```
    Sample Code
    ```
    http://client_id:client_password@api.milesmart.com/client_code
    ```
2. Open the `/login` endpoint with client_code as url argument in a new window or new tab of the browser
3. After the login, use `/token` endpoint to get the token by passing client_code as argument.
    Sample Code
    ```
    http://api.milesmart.com/token?client_code=s_token
    ```
